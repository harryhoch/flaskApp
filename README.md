# flaskApp
A flaskApp at a very basic level.
Currently it can search the driver and SGA frequency cancer type distribution for a specific SGA. The result is returned in the format of bar chart.

# Planned Improvements
* split down the template with {% block %}
* error handling (not found) -- Flash
* change data transferation with API & format of JSON ?
* include d3.js
* add download function for gene search (Filter criteria: tumor set, driver set, DEG set)
